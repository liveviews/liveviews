# LiveViews

This is a list of libraries for creating dynamic web applications that handle user interaction with the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) on the server.
These libraries are different from component-based web UI libraries.
They operate at the level of HTML rather than GUI widgets,
which means the developer gets a blank canvas (with its advantages and disadvantages), isn't tied to a particular set of components, and can directly use their knowledge of HTML.

The list strives to be complete rather than [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).
You may see libraries that are not maintained, not ready for production, or both.
